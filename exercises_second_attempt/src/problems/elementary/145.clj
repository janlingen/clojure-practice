(comment "For the win")


(comment "Clojure's for macro is a tremendously versatile mechanism for
producing a sequence based on some other sequence(s). It can take some time to
understand how to use it properly, but that investment will be paid back with
clear, concise sequence-wrangling later. With that in mind, read over these for
expressions and try to see how each of them produces the same result.")
