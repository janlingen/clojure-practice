(comment "Create a function of no arguments
which returns a string that is
an exact copy of the function itself.

Hint: Read up on quines if you get stuck
(this question is harder than it first appears);
but itâ€™s worth the effort to solve it independently if you can!

Fun fact: Gus is the name of the 4Clojure dragon.")
