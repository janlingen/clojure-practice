(comment "Comparisons")


(comment "For any orderable data type it's possible to derive all of the
basic comparison operations (<, ≤, =, ≠, ≥, and >) from a single operation (any
operator but = or ≠ will work). Write a function that takes three arguments, a
less than operator for the data and two items to compare. The function should
return a keyword describing the relationship between the two items. The keywords
for the relationship between x and y are as follows:

  x = y → :eq
  x > y → :gt
  x < y → :lt")


(defn solution
  [f a b] (cond
            (= > f) (if (f a b) :gt :lt) 
            (= < f) (if (f a b) :lt :gt)
            :else :eq))


(assert (and (= :gt (solution < 5 1))
             (= :eq (solution (fn [x y] (< (count x) (count y))) "pear" "plum"))
             (= :lt (solution (fn [x y] (< (mod x 5) (mod y 5))) 21 3))
